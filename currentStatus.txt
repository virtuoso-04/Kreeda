Comparison of Current Project State with Roadmap

1. Setup & Core Capture
Goal: Mobile app that records and processes basic fitness tests.
Current State:
Mobile App Skeleton: Achieved. The React Native app is functional with a flow for recording and uploading videos.
Video Capture & Storage: Achieved. Videos are recorded and stored locally in MP4 format.
Offline-first Storage: Partially achieved. The app supports local storage, but syncing functionality is not fully detailed or tested.
Status: ✅ On track. The core mobile app functionality is in place.

2. AI Core + Cheat Detection
Goal: AI-powered analysis with pose estimation, rep counting, and cheat detection.
Current State:
Pose Estimation Integration: Achieved. MediaPipe is integrated for pose detection.
Rep Counting: Achieved. Rule-based rep counting is implemented.
Cheat Detection: Partially achieved. Frame duplication and face consistency checks are implemented, but further testing and optimization may be needed.
Performance Benchmarking: Not fully implemented. Dummy datasets are used, but no real benchmarking pipeline is in place.
Quick Backend: Achieved. FastAPI backend is functional and processes video uploads.
Status: ✅ On track, but performance benchmarking and scalability need attention.

3. Dashboard + Edge Demonstration
Goal: A compelling dashboard for judges with AI overlays and gamification.
Current State:
Official Dashboard: Achieved. The Streamlit dashboard is functional and displays results with overlays.
Gamification & Engagement: Not implemented. Progress bars and badges are missing.
Offline → Sync Flow: Partially achieved. The app supports offline recording, but syncing to the dashboard is not fully automated.
Polish for Demo: Partially achieved. Multilingual support is in place, but gamification and a fully polished demo pipeline are incomplete.
Status: ⚠️ Partially on track. The dashboard is functional, but gamification and syncing need work.

4. MVP Core Functionality
Goal: End-to-end functionality for recording, analyzing, and displaying results.
Current State:
Mobile App: Achieved. The app records videos and uploads them for analysis.
AI/ML Core: Achieved. Pose detection, rep counting, and basic cheat detection are functional.
Dashboard: Achieved. The dashboard displays results and overlays.
Status: ✅ Achieved. The MVP is functional, but scalability and polish are needed for industry-grade quality.

5. Edge Over Others
Goal: Offline-first design, cheat detection, AI overlays, multilingual support, and end-to-end flow.
Current State:
Offline-first MVP: Partially achieved. Offline recording works, but syncing is not seamless.
Cheat Detection Demo: Achieved. Basic cheat detection is functional.
AI Pose Overlay in Dashboard: Achieved. Overlays are displayed in the dashboard.
Multi-language + Gamification: Partially achieved. Multilingual support is in place, but gamification is missing.
End-to-End Flow: Partially achieved. The flow works, but syncing and polish need improvement.
Status: ⚠️ Partially on track. The core features are functional, but additional polish is needed to stand out.



Updated Roadmap for Scalability and Industry-Grade Quality


1. Scalability Enhancements
Backend:
Optimize FastAPI for high concurrency using ASGI servers like uvicorn with workers.
Add database support (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing results and user data.
Implement JWT-based authentication for secure multi-user access.
Frontend:
Add pagination and filtering for large datasets in the dashboard.
Optimize React Native app for low-end devices with further performance profiling.

2. Industry-Grade Features
Cheat Detection:
Enhance cheat detection with machine learning models for anomaly detection.
Add more robust identity verification using face recognition.
Gamification:
Implement progress bars, badges, and leaderboards in the dashboard and app.
Multilingual Support:
Expand to more regional languages (e.g., Tamil, Bengali, Telugu).
Add dynamic language switching in the dashboard.


3. End-to-End Flow
Offline Sync:
Implement a background sync service in the app to upload results when connectivity is restored.
Demo Pipeline:
Create a fully polished demo pipeline with pre-recorded videos and dummy athlete profiles.


4. Performance Benchmarking
AI Models:
Benchmark AI models on diverse datasets to ensure accuracy across demographics.
Optimize pose estimation for real-time performance on low-end devices.
System Load Testing:
Conduct load testing on the backend to ensure it can handle multiple concurrent users.


5. Deployment and Monitoring
Deployment:
Containerize the backend and dashboard using Docker for easy deployment.
Deploy the system on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
Monitoring:
Add logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time system health checks.
Conclusion
The project is on track for the MVP, but additional work is needed to achieve scalability and industry-grade quality. The updated roadmap focuses on enhancing scalability, adding industry-grade features, and polishing the end-to-end flow. Let me know if you'd like further assistance with any specific tasks!
