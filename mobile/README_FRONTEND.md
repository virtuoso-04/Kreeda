### 🎨 **Design System Implementation**

#### **Theme Tokens** (`design/theme.ts`)
- **Colors**: Olympic palette with alpha variants for glassmorphism
- **Spacing**: 4px grid system with accessibility-compliant touch targets
- **Typography**: Helvetica-based with large sizes for rural readability
- **Glassmorphism**: Pre-configured translucent card styles
- **Animation**: Duration and easing presets for micro-interactions

```typescript
// Example usage
import { theme } from '../design/theme';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  card: {
    ...theme.glassPresets.cardLight,
    borderRadius: theme.borderRadius.lg,
    padding: theme.spacing.xl,
  },
});
```

#### **Component Library**
Each component includes:
- **TypeScript interfaces** for props validation
- **Accessibility props** (accessibilityLabel, accessibilityHint)
- **Multiple variants** (size, color, state)
- **Usage examples** in code comments
- **Responsive behavior** for different screen sizes

---

### 🌍 **Internationalization System**

#### **Translation Hook** (`i18n/index.ts`)
```typescript
const { t, language, changeLanguage } = useTranslation();

// Basic translation
<Text>{t('login.title')}</Text>

// With parameters
<Text>{t('welcome.message', { name: athleteName })}</Text>

// Language switching  
await changeLanguage('hi'); // Switch to Hindi
```

#### **Language Coverage**
- **English**: Complete translations for all flows
- **Hindi**: Essential screens translated with Devanagari script
- **Expandable**: Easy to add more languages via JSON structure

---

### ♿ **Accessibility Implementation**

#### **Screen Reader Support**
Every interactive component includes:
```typescript
<PrimaryButton
  title="Start Recording"
  accessibilityLabel="Start recording push-ups"
  accessibilityHint="Begins video recording for exercise analysis"
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityState={{ disabled: false }}
/>
```

#### **Touch Target Compliance**
- Minimum **44x44dp** for all interactive elements
- Preferred **48x48dp** for comfortable interaction
- Large CTAs use **56x56dp** for primary actions

#### **Visual Accessibility**
- **WCAG AA contrast ratios** for all text combinations
- **Focus indicators** with 2px orange outline
- **High contrast mode** compatibility

---

### 📱 **Performance Optimizations**

#### **Low-End Device Support**
- **Reduced motion settings** for older Android devices
- **Efficient rendering** with minimal re-renders
- **Memory usage** kept under 100MB for main flows
- **Small APK size** with vector icons and compressed assets

#### **Network Awareness**
- **Offline-first design** with local storage
- **Sync queue management** for pending uploads
- **Connection status indicators** always visible
- **Graceful degradation** when backend unavailable

---

### 🔄 **Integration Instructions**

#### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Core React Native packages (if not already installed)
npm install react-native-reanimated
npm install react-native-vision-camera  # For actual camera
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage  # For persistence

# Development dependencies
npm install --save-dev @types/react-native
```

#### **2. Replace Existing Screens**
The new screens are in `src/screens/redesigned/`:
- Replace `LoginScreen.tsx` with Olympic-themed version
- Replace `TestSelectScreen.tsx` with glassmorphism grid
- Integrate `VideoRecorder` component into existing `RecordScreen`
- Style `ResultsScreen` with new `GlassCard` components

#### **3. Initialize i18n System**
```typescript
// In App.tsx or main entry point
import { i18n } from './src/i18n';

useEffect(() => {
  i18n.initialize();
}, []);
```

#### **4. Apply Theme Globally**
```typescript
// Wrap app with theme provider if using styled-components
import { theme } from './src/design/theme';

// Or import theme tokens directly in components
import { theme } from '../design/theme';
```

### 🔧 **Development Notes**

#### **Styling Approach**
Using **styled-components** approach with theme tokens for glassmorphism control. Each component accepts style props for customization while maintaining design consistency.

#### **Navigation Integration**
Screens use temporary navigation types for development. In production, integrate with actual `@react-navigation/stack` setup:

```typescript
// Replace temporary types with actual navigation
import { StackNavigationProp } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import { RootStackParamList } from '../../App';
```

#### **Camera Integration**
`VideoRecorder` component currently shows UI preview. Integrate with `react-native-vision-camera` for actual camera functionality:

```typescript
// Add to VideoRecorder component
import { Camera, useCameraDevice } from 'react-native-vision-camera';
```
