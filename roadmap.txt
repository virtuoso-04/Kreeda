# Roadmap for MVP Prototype

## ðŸ”¹ Setup & Core Capture
**Goal**: Get a mobile app that records + processes basic fitness tests.

### Mobile App Skeleton
- **Framework**: React Native
- **UI Flow**: Login â†’ Choose Test (Push-ups, Sit-ups, Vertical Jump) â†’ Record â†’ Upload/Analyze

### Video Capture & Storage
- Use mobile camera for video recording.
- Save locally in compressed format (MP4, H.264).

### Offline-first Storage
- Store results & videos in SQLite/local storage.
- **Edge Factor**: Small APK (<25MB), works on entry-level phones.

âœ… **Deliverable by EOD Day 1**:
- A working mobile app that lets users record video of a test and stores it offline.

---

## ðŸ”¹ AI Core + Cheat Detection
**Goal**: Show the AI magic (core differentiator).

### Pose Estimation Integration
- Use MediaPipe / OpenPose in Python backend or TensorFlow Lite in mobile app.
- Detect joints â†’ Validate push-up/sit-up posture.

### Rep Counting
- Simple rule-based counting from pose landmarks.

### Cheat Detection (Lightweight)
- Detect suspicious freeze frames / tampering using OpenCV (check sudden frame skips).
- Validate identity using face detection consistency across frames.

### Performance Benchmarking
- Compare counts/time against sample norms (just use dummy dataset now).

### Quick Backend (Optional for demo)
- FastAPI/Flask API to receive video â†’ run AI model â†’ return result JSON.

âœ… **Deliverable by EOD Day 2**:
- A video recording analyzed by AI: count reps, validate posture, show "valid/invalid reps".
- Cheat detection alert if tampering is suspected.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Dashboard + Edge Demonstration
**Goal**: Make it visible & compelling for judges.

### Official Dashboard (Web App)
- Simple React dashboard or Streamlit app:
  - Upload/receive results from mobile.
  - Show athlete profile (Name, Age, Test Results).
  - AI overlay (video playback with skeleton overlay).

### Gamification & Engagement
- Progress bar: "You did 12 push-ups out of 20 standard."
- Badge for completing tests.

### Offline â†’ Sync Flow
- Record offline â†’ Sync results to dashboard when internet comes back.

### Polish for Demo
- Add 2â€“3 regional language support (Hindi, Bengali) for extra edge.
- Show one working athlete profile pipeline end-to-end:
  - Record â†’ AI analysis â†’ Cheat detection â†’ Dashboard report.

âœ… **Deliverable by Demo**:
- A live demo:
  - Record a push-up test on phone â†’ AI counts reps & flags posture â†’ Results synced to dashboard.
  - Judges see dashboard with athlete profile + standardized score.

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Core Functionality (Hackathon Version)

### Mobile App
- Record short videos of fitness tests (push-ups, sit-ups, jump).
- Offline storage â†’ later sync.

### AI/ML Core
- Pose detection with MediaPipe.
- Rep counting & basic form validation.
- Lightweight cheat detection (tampering/identity consistency).

### Dashboard
- Display athlete profile & test results.
- Video playback with pose overlay.
- Benchmark comparison (dummy dataset for now).

## ðŸ’¡ Edge Over Others (Judgesâ€™ Wow Factors)
- **Offline-first MVP**: Usable in villages with poor connectivity.
- **Cheat detection demo**: Integrity + fairness (others may skip this).
- **AI Pose Overlay in Dashboard**: Judges can see AI in action.
- **Multi-language + Gamification**: Inclusive & engaging.
- **End-to-End Flow**: Record â†’ Analyze â†’ Dashboard â†’ Benchmark.
